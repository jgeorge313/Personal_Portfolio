# Utilities

The Utilities folder contains two scripts that are helpful when compiling the Monthly Business Report (MBR).

To reduce code-clutter and promote consistency across the organization, Fraud analysts share a helper functions script that defines useful functions necessary to interact with data.

Additionally, I created several functions that are useful for monthly reporting in the MBR_FX script. The script helps create month-over-month percent change performance tables, which helps the audience gauge how meaningful any monthly change is.
