This repository contains work I've done that utilizes data science principals while I was at the University in Virginia (UVa).

Housed in the Academic Examples Folder are:

1. Past materials from a final round interview I had with Zappos as a Data Science Intern (Fall 2016).
2. A 75-minute interactive lesson plan for graduate and undergraduate students on Tableau and data Visualizations (Fall 2017).
3. My final presentation as part of COMM 4320 Entertainment Marketing (Fall 2017).
4. My final presentation as a part of COMM 4260 Business Analytics (Fall 2017).

## Academic Background

Before going to college, I was blessed with the opportunity to take fundamental math courses (Calc 1,2, AP Stats) as well as the encouragement to 
use data to predict the future. At Maggie Walker Governor's school, located in Richmond Virginia, seniors were required to take a senior seminar.
I enrolled in Freakonomics, a seminar that like it's namesake, was devoted to exploring the relationships between different phenomena in a quantitative fashion.
The Titanic Kaggle challenge was my first introduction to the field, and I remember spending hours trying various feature manipulations in order to get promising 
test-set predictions. The thrill of discovery and experimentation with data in Excel made a lasting impression and led me to my Statistics major at the University of Virginia.

Having completed 50 credits as a high-school student, I freed up enough space in my schedule for a double major in Commerce and Statistics. 
The McIntire's School of Commerce selection of only the sharpest UVa undergraduate students resulted in a phenomenal, team driven learning enviornment. 
Each day, as students discussed various business scenarios, my critical thinking skill grew and grew. Additionally, the real world examples served as an
excellent opportunity to combine some of my statistic major skills to solve problems. 

For example, within the Business Analytics Folder is my final presentation for COMM 4260 Business Analytics. 
The project used real data provided to us by our corproate partner, ApartmentGuide.com to provide a strategy regarding retargetting prospects. 
I'm happy to say that my team's presentation was chosen by the professor as the exemplar presentation used in the following semester :).
