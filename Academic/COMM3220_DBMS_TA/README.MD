# COMM3220 DBMS TA

In my Fall Semester my Senior Year, I was the Lead Teaching Assistant of the Class COMM 3220: Database Management Systems and Business Intelligence under Professor Suprateek Sarker. As part of the job, I was to lecture the undergraduate and graduate students who were taking the class on Tableau, visualizations, and storytelling. My lecture plan that I made for a 75-minute lecture can be found in this repo.

This lecture served as the unit on Tableau and Visualizations in the class. Additionally, this class taught how to connect Microsoft SQL Server to Tableau as well as the benefits of doing so, versus uploading a CSV file.
