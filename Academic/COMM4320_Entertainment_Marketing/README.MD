# COMM 4320

Entertainment Marketing was a class I took during my Fall Semester Senior Year at the McIntire School of Commerce at the University of Virginia. The class covered important marketing tactics that were industry specific to the various types of entertainment industries including: music, live events, movies, games, etc.

The class was split up into groups and each group did a deep dive on a particular industry in the Entertainment Industry, with a deep dive on a particular company. My team and I were assigned the gaming industry, where we most interestingly analyzed emerging trends in the Augmented/Virtual Reality space. This class really inspired my passion for the entertainment industry, as the future of the industry continues to evolve at a blistering pace.

In the team project, I contributed strategically, coming up with the overall narrative of the presentation, as well as helping with the visual design of the PowerPoint. Additionally, I sourced Euromonitor data for the worldwide gaming industry and used Tableau (and PowerPoint animations) to highlight China's rapid growth in the industry.
