## Zappos Take Home Interview Submission

The "10.15.17 Zappos Marketing Analytics Internship Presentation - Joby George.pdf" is the presentation I submitted as part of a Zappos Marketing Analytics Internship fall semester my Junior Year in college. For this interview, Zappos sent over a CSV data file of aggregated footwear industry sales data and tasked applicants to submit their findings after 3 daysâ€™ time.

In my response, I emphasized my communications knowledge by presenting the bottom-line up front and then proposed my recommendations to what the problems I thought were most important, yet addressable from the data given.

I calculated derived metrics from the data given to support my arguments. I used Tableau and Excel to visualize how returns for Zappos during Q4 holiday times were worse than competitors, most likely due to the digital channel for a fit-based industry. Lastly i used linear regression to find a complimentary industry for Zappos, inferring this from a negative correlation coefficient between the industries market size.

This presentation helped me secure a spot for the final round of interviews for the Zappos Marketing Analytics Internship.

At the interview, I was shocked to find myself in the midst of graduate students. Unfortunately for me, I hadn't gone through my marketing course-work at the McIntire School of commerce yet, nor had i taken highly relevant statistics courses. As a result I was not chosen for the position. The rejection was a powerful motivating force to continue to improve my knowledge and skill-set for future job-interviews
