# Overall Objective 

I want to have a place to reflect on myself, and show who I am to the world.

# Backdrop

2020 has been a second year of emotional dynamicism. At the beginning of the year, burdened heavily by imposter syndrome and fear of rejection I put myself out there and applied to New York University's MS in Data Science. 

This was a stressful time in my life. Figuring out my personal brand was a difficult task. Co-ordinating a letter of recommendation from a Professor who was out of the country during the winter holidays and having one of the people I hoped write my letter enter maternity leave left me feeling unpolished. 

I didn't have the best application I could prepare, however, I was going to still do my best. I prepared another [repository](link) as testament to the work I had done. I finalized my essays and submitted my application the day before the deadline. With that mountain of weight off my shoulders, I decided I was done with the application process -- and fate would determine my future.

Friday, March 13, my prayers were answered and I could be seen imitating Tiger Woods, thrusting my fist in the air celebrating acceptance. 
After getting the good news, I felt thrilled, and I was inspired to better myself, and add polish to my pursuits. 

June 1st, the first day of this portfolio, shows just how much reality can change. My life dream of being a graduate student in data science has been altered. With COVID-19 helping me reprioritize what's important to me, I've moved back home to spend time with my parents and brother in Richmond Virginia.

Since moving home during , I've familiarized myself with a new normal. My mom's ritual of coughing - one wave comes as she wakes up, with her best attempt at supressing coughs unable to hold back the irration. In this new normal, I've learned to accept the risk that my behaviors have, and resultingly, keep my physical social life 'in the family'.

As a person with depression, this isolation fear and uncertainty has undoubtedly withered my passion and positive outlook of my future. The vision to improve myself and become the change I wanted to see in the world was replaced by an unproductive sense of negativity, where my future education, and self-actualization seemed far more distant than they had three months ago.

This Portfolio represents my fight. In order to let the fire of my dream burn on, it has to be lit continuously. I'm hoping to add something, at least, *one* commit to this portfolio per day. Through these commits I will grow again substantiate the road that I want to walk on for my future.
