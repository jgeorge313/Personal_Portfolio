# Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio which is specifically focused on highlighting relevant university assignments and work experience for future Data Science or Data engineering roles.

Given the amount of content in this portfolio, I wanted to take a moment to outline how the portfolio is organized and what is demonstrated in each section.

I've organized this portfolio into three sections:

    Academic Examples
    Professional Work

The Academic Examples section showcases numerous analytic based team projects that I completed my junior and senior year at the McIntire School of Commerce at the University of Virginia and a guide on Tableau I made as a teaching assistant for Database Management (COMM 3220).
Software used includes R, RapidMiner, Tableau, and a little bit of Python.

My Professional Work section utilizes pseudo-code to demonstrate the First Party Fraud Monthly Monitoring Repository. The Repository outlines a beginning-to-end process of monitoring business and Fraud defense performance. Starting with data collection, then moving to data wrangling and massaging, all the way to data presentation in the form of PowerPoint Slides (the final outcome). Software used include: Databricks (Python language and Pandas), SQL.


## Academic Examples

Housed in the Academic Examples Folder are:

    1. Past materials from a final round interview I had with Zappos as a Data Science Intern (Fall 2017).
    2. A 75-minute interactive lesson plan for graduate and undergraduate students on Tableau and data Visualizations (Fall 2017).
    3. My final presentation as part of COMM 4320 Entertainment Marketing (Fall 2017).
    4. My final presentation as a part of COMM 4260 Business Analytics (Fall 2017).
    5. My final Presentation as a part of COMM 4350 Customer Analytics (Spring 2018)

## Professional Work

I am not allowed to replicate the code I have written as a part of Capital One due to confidentiality. 

However, in the Professional Work section, I describe the process that the team uses to complete monthly required monitoring that gets sent out to external regulators such as the OCC. 

The repository was built out in my first month, and has still been served as the monitoring skeleton we use to complete First Party Fraud monitoring.
