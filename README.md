# Personal_Portfolio

Weclome to my personal portfolio!

In this portfolio, I am striving to demonstrate how my experinces make me a qualified candidate.

I've organized this portfolio into three sections:

    Academic Examples
    Professional Work
    Passions
    

## Academic Examples

Housed in the Academic Examples Folder are:

    1. Past materials from a final round interview I had with Zappos as a Data Science Intern (Fall 2016).
    2. A 75-minute interactive lesson plan for graduate and undergraduate students on Tableau and data Visualizations (Fall 2017).
    3. My final presentation as part of COMM 4320 Entertainment Marketing (Fall 2017).
    4. My final presentation as a part of COMM 4260 Business Analytics (Fall 2017).

## Professional Work

I am not allowed to replicate the code I have written as a part of Capital One due to confidentiality. 

However, in the Professional Work section, I describe the process that the team uses to complete monthly required monitoring that gets sent out to external regulators such as the OCC. 

The repository was built out in my first month, and has still been served as the monitoring skeleton we use to complete First Party Fraud monitoring.

## Passions

Outside of my passion for Data Science, listening to music has been a passion of mine. In the Passions folder, I've included my Spotify Wrapped 2019 summary. Since 2017, i listened to music via Spotify for at least **84 days each year**, or around 25% of the 365 day year (no I don't leave the application running when I went to sleep). 

Music was a gateway to a different world, one that the artist was trying to take me to. I relish discovering the tiniest details in production or mixing of my favorite song, even more so if i've already listened to the song dozens of times. Music was also the tie to the community that supported me in a rigorous academic environment. Ater a long day of classes and group work, I would often find myself at a friends apartment turned studio. At the studio, I would mull on some of my business curriculua case readings while my friends experimented patiently, changing the inflection of the vocals, slowing the tempo down, and etc. Soaking up  creativity and the creative process from my friends has only increased my appreciation for a great song. 

I believe that Data Science will have a strong impact on the music industry from automated music generation to marketing tactics, the hard to define field of art and entertainment will be increasingly monitored and measured. With the industry already changing rapidly due to music streaming and social media, there is a seemingly narrower and narrower gap for up-and-coming aritsts to squeeze through, as powerful brands and artists flex their dominance. After graduating, I'm hoping to make a difference in this field and ensure that artists can continue to have shot at making it. 

### Mental Health

Music and the artistic community has helped me through trying times. However, I'm not ashamed to say that life after graduation, and the loss of that community caused me to take a step back in my mental health. After falling on rough times and not knowing how to get better, I asked for the help I needed. Getting it wasn't easy, but the pain made clear the need to take care of myself. To meet this need I've committed to a foundation of exercise, meditation via the Headspace app, journaling accompanied with therapy. 

As Laurie Santos describes in her famous course [The Science of Well-being](https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being), being happy is not a passive state, but rather an active process. Creating a space where your physical and emotional needs are taken care of is an ever-changing dance, but it's an often ignored, yet imperative behavior when trying to 'be happy'.
