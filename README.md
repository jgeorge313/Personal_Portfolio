# Personal_Portfolio

Weclome to my personal portfolio!

In this portfolio, I am striving to demonstrate how my experinces make me a qualified candidate.

I've organized this portfolio into three sections:

    Academic Examples
    Professional Work
    Passions
    

## Academic Examples

Housed in the Academic Examples Folder are:

    1. Past materials from a final round interview I had with Zappos as a Data Science Intern (Fall 2016).
    2. A 75-minute interactive lesson plan for graduate and undergraduate students on Tableau and data Visualizations (Fall 2017).
    3. My final presentation as part of COMM 4320 Entertainment Marketing (Fall 2017).
    4. My final presentation as a part of COMM 4260 Business Analytics (Fall 2017).

## Professional Work

I am not allowed to replicate the code I have written as a part of Capital One due to confidentiality. 

However, in the Professional Work section, I describe the process that the team uses to complete monthly required monitoring that gets sent out to external regulators such as the OCC. 

The repository was built out in my first month, and has still been served as the monitoring skeleton we use to complete First Party Fraud monitoring.
