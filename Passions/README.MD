## Music

Music has always been something that has been important to me. As a source of inspiration when times were tough or a lens into another world, music has been a large part of my life.

Within this folder, I've attached my Spotify 2019 Wrapped, which highlights that i used the platform for over 120,000 minutes in 2018 and 2019. 

After taking the Entertainment Industry marketing course as a part of the McIntire School of Commerce, the problem space in the industry of connecting with and engaging fans is exciting. With all of the technoligical and computational changes in the past 10 years, the industry is well poised for a shift as consumers embrace streaming and are looking for the next era of music consumption.

I would love to gain experience and potentially further my career in the music industry, as the applications of data science expand.
