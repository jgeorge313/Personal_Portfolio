## Music

Music has always been something that has been important to me. As a source of inspiration when times were tough or a lens into another world, music has been a large part of my life.

Within this folder, I've attached my Spotify 2019 Wrapped, which highlights that i used the platform for over 120,000 minutes in 2018 and 2019. 

After taking the Entertainment Industry marketing course as a part of the McIntire School of Commerce, the problem space in the industry of connecting with and engaging fans is exciting. With all of the technoligical and computational changes in the past 10 years, the industry is well poised for a shift as consumers embrace streaming and are looking for the next era of music consumption.

I would love to gain experience and potentially further my career in the music industry, as the applications of data science expand.

## Mental Health

Maintaining my own mental health and taking the time to stop has been a key aspect of my personal growth since college. 

As an undergraduate an intense schedule over a short duration of time was manageable. I started using the Headspace app my Junior year to bring moments of calm into a hectic schedule, and had a strong support system with my friends. Worst comes to worst, the temporary burn-out can be rested away with the long winter and summer breaks.

However, when you must make decisions every day without breaks, it's important to be in good condition so that none of your work suffers. Working yourself into exhaustion trying to achieve perfection in the short term, poorly positions yourself for the inevitable follow-ups or unrelated emergency.  

Meditation was not enough to deal with a deep depression that I found myself in my first year working. Recognizing I needed help, I tried various medications before finding one that worked. This experience was confusing, frustrating, and painful. The Genesight genetic test revealed that my body was genotypically compatible with only 2 anti-depressants, ending to rest a nine-month experiment. In November 2019, I switched to Pristiq, and have noticeably improved since. (I've attached a copy of the front page of the report in this repository).

As someone who had a bumpy road before getting help, I know how difficult it can even be to asking for help is from beginning to end. The stigma surrounding mental health issues is real. I hope my story can serve as an example that everyone needs help and that getting the help you need can change your whole worldview. 

I'm proud to say now that one year after initially starting Pristiq, I am completely off the medication and feel better than I have in years.
